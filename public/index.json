This is strict deadline and there is no more extension.\nAccording to expressions of interest of proposals we accepted, we focus on evaluation technology and software for the layer 2 technology.\nWe also extend the due date of full proposal to May 25. Anyone can propose evaluation technology and its implementation to this competition even if you did not sent us an expression of interest.\nWe uploaded a sample of application document.\n Call for proposal and rules of competition December 8, 2017, BSafe.network (Revision April 21, 2018)\n1. Background of BSafe.network affiliated competition series and reasons for holding layer 2 competition Nowadays, many cryptocurrency projects and blockchain based projects are becoming reality, and there are a large number of technologies and implementations. The development of theory and technology to make blockchains mature enough for actual applications is important if we are to provide a foundation for building upon, much like what happened with the Internet itself. Scaling Bitcoin and other academic conferences are the places to find the future progress of blockchain technology. In addition to such conferences, we need a place to provide scientific evidence to evaluate and compare blockchain technologies. This evidence is not limited to performance, but also security, privacy, game theory, economics, and regulation. BSafe.network is the neutral academic research test network by international universities with 24 universities currently participating. BSafe.network plans to hold a series of open technology competitions on many aspects of blockchain technologies. The aims of the open competition are:\n facilitating development and progress of theory, conducting technology verification over BSafe.network, providing review by university researchers/professors, providing the source of scientific/academic results, and publishing technically reviewed software.  Currently, \u0026ldquo;layer 2 technology for blockchain\u0026rdquo; is a category of technology to enhance blockchain based transactions by connecting the decentralized nature of blockchain and actual applications by segregating a huge number of transactions. There are also other types of layer 2 technology to enhance privacy. Lightning network and TumbleBit are examples of Layer 2 technologies. Because layer 2 protocols provide different trust models than blockchains, there may be trade-offs among performance, security, privacy and so on. This competition aims to have deep and scientific knowledge of designing and evaluating layer 2 technology to facilitate further research and development of layer 2 technology.\n2. Goals The goals of this competition are\n Collecting attack models on layer 2 networks, building measurement of security and performance of layer 2 technology. and better understanding the trade-offs of using layer 2 technology.  This competition does not aim to select some technologies as standards or candidates of standards. It aims to provide public academia backed data and research results. Outcomes to the public are as follows.\n Program codes: cc-by license  Layer 2 attack/evaluation software codes Evaluation software codes/platform  Evaluation data for each proposal Common evaluation dataset  As byproducts of this competition, we can provide public security testing theory and tools for Layer 2 technologies.\n3. Category of the competition At the first competition, we conduct the competition for evaluation technology.\nWe call for technology evaluation methodology and software for layer 2 technology. They include common datasets for evaluation. Please refer to section 4 for evaluation criteria to be considered.\n4. Evaluation method In this competition, we evaluate each proposal in two ways; theoretical evaluation and experimental evaluation. Theoretical evaluation is reviewing submitted technical documents by university researchers through a scientific review process. Experimental evaluation is performing experiments for each submission using BSafe.network isolated research test network by installing submitted software and running each blockchain network for three months, with evaluation datasets. Experiments include not only performance evaluation but also security evaluation and attacks performed by university researchers.\n5. Evaluation metrics Supposed evaluation metrics include but not limited to\n1) Performance\na) Number of transactions/sec\nb) Network latency\n2)Security/Trust\na) Resistance to fault/crash/attack to nodes\nb) Degree of decentralization\nc) Resistance to DoS attack to make layer 2 transactions fail\nd) Scenario and data set to evaluate\ne) Availability of layer 2 nodes\n3)Privacy/Fungibility\na) Correlation among transactions\nb) Unlinkability among transactions\nc) Unlinkability to identity\n6. Schedule  Call for submission start: December 8, 2017 Submission deadline: March 31, 2018 Submission of expression of interest: 23:59 UTC April 6 Full submission deadline: 23:59 UTC May 18 Full submission deadline: 23:59 UTC May 25 Evaluation and experimentation start: May 21, 2018 Disclosure of a list of proposals: May 30, 2018 Evaluation and experimentation end: July 31, 2018 Announcement of a winner and excellent proposals: August, 2018 Technical presentation and awarding ceremony: September, 2018  7. Submission procedure Anyone can submit a proposal to this competition, but need to meet the following procedure and submission requirements. Each submitter must submit the following.\n Cover sheet  Name of submitter(s) with the corresponding submitter Email address Name of technology  Technical documents  Design rationale Algorithm specification and supporting documents Self-evaluation documents in security and efficiency Intellectual property disclosure  Software code  Any programming language is acceptable Installation documentation is needed. Providing installation package is recommended.   A sample of application document.\nAll submitters need to carefully submit the program code to avoid security vulnerabilities and bugs. Before running software over BSafe.network, we will conduct the security analysis and source code check. If we found any major problem in the code, the proposal is not considered for the competition. If the evaluating committee judges that the technical documents do not contain enough information and data for theoretical evaluation, the proposal is not considered for the competition. Note that no code changes are allowed after submission.\n8. B-Prize We are planning to award a winner and excellent proposals \u0026ldquo;B-Prize\u0026rdquo; with certain amount of money. Details will be announced when it is decided.\n9. Note on business neutrality The layer 2 technology competition focuses on providing technical knowledge to help further research and development. The result does not endorse anything about other aspects including soundness of business, exchange rates of cryptocurrencies and tokens. To preserve business neutrality, we do not evaluate any proposal with existing/upcoming plans of ICO or selling tokens.\n10. Evaluating committee (alphabetical order)  Chen Feng, University of British Columbia Joaquin Garcia-Alfaro, Telecom Sud Paris Ethan Heilman, Boston University Jordi Herrera Joancomartí, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona Jameson Lopp, BitGo Jeremy Rubin, Bitcoin Core Contributor Rusty Russell, Blockstream Shigeya Suzuki, Keio University  Other committee members will be added after confirmation.\n11.

This is strict deadline and there is no more extension.\nAccording to expressions of interest of proposals we accepted, we focus on evaluation technology and software for the layer 2 technology.\nWe also extend the due date of full proposal to May 25. Anyone can propose evaluation technology and its implementation to this competition even if you did not sent us an expression of interest.\nWe uploaded a sample of application document.\n Goals The goal of the BSafe.network is to construct a neutral, stable and sustainable research network for blockchain technology. This network is used for academic research, not only scientific research but also interdisciplinary social and economic research. BSafe.network aims to mimic the same degree of impact that BSD ( Berkeley Software Distribution) and the NSFNET (The National Science Foundation Network) had on the evolution of the Internet. The former provided robust, liberally licensed software that put into practice the many theoretical advances made by academia. The latter scaled expertise, experience and resources.\nTo realize a sustainable and decentralized blockchain network, large numbers of stable and neutral nodes are needed. The BSafe.network aims to help build this network by using the neutral role of a University. BSafe.network aims to have a criticial mass of nodes as a proportion of the current number of Bitcoin nodes.\nBSafe.network aims to connect academia and real-life development, and to be a testbed and trust anchor for any research and real-life technology and application. For example, Bitcoin and other blockchain technology such as Ethereum can be linked to BSafe.network. The research results can be used for the future development of reliable technology, applications, technology and operational guidelines to which society can refer for the safe use of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.\nBenefit  We can have a reliable and neutral blockchain network for academic research with large number of nodes. Researchers conduct any blockchain related research. Researchers conduct international joint research over the BSafe.network. We can easily provide the research results, which include technology, codes and experimental results, to public.  What to do  Research Evaluation Competition  How it works Each university become a node of this network. That is, the group of the member university operates a blockchain network. Some member university can deploy software to conduct experiment or evaluation of research results.\nWho may join Universities and individual researchers can join the BSafe.network. Each participant must eventually operate a node of the BSafe.network in their protocol of research interest. Because neutrality is critical value of the BSafe.network, private companies can join research over BSafe.network through university.\nMedia Articles  Battle-Testing Lightning: 26 Schools Start Contest to Secure Bitcoin’s Layer 2 (CoinDesk, January 20, 2018) Bitcoin Testing Matures as Global Universities Join BSafe Network (CoinDesk, June 30, 2016) Blockchain Technology: Opportunities for Africa  White Paper The white paper of BSafe.network is here\n"
