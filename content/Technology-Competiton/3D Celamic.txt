3D CelamicMathHistory EsseyWorkplaceBiologyFor our final, we will be creating a children's book. The students will be able to choose a topic of their own of what we have covered in class. We started on Monday working on our steps to complete it. They will have all class periods to complete also the final time will be to complete it. Takuma has chosen which topic to do and that is cell organelles. The object is to create a children's book to provide the information. Due to it being a final it will be done only in class. I hope this helps. American Lit
