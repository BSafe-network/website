### Background

On June 8th and 9th 2019, Distributed Ledger Technology-related innovations have been referenced in the Communique at the G20 Finance and Central Bank Meeting in Fukuoka, Japan, referencing the report produced by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) - https://fsb.org/about

* G20 Communique
Section 13 "We welcome the FSB report on decentralized financial technologies, and the possible implications for financial stability, regulation and governance, and how regulators can enhance the dialogue with a wider group of stakeholders.” https://mof.go.jp/english/international_policy/convention/g20/communique.htm?fbclid=IwAR2gyy7LFqed1L4L8M-71KRnIUFtpgj3yArNfZzuD1CqbdaUy57r6Fy4J9Q

### Blockchain Multi-Stakeholder CoDeFi Workshop

This workshop is designed to provide multi-stakeholders an environment for the understanding, exploration and discussion of the Coordination of Decentralized Finance (CoDeFi). As permissionless blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms evolve and mature, there is a need for multi-stakeholders to engage in their planning, development, roll-out, and operation, in order for innovation of a wide variety of financial applications to proliferate and become mainstream. Thus far it has been mainly developer & startup communities which are driving these protocols, platforms, and applications for this new era of computing. New standards, governance mechanisms and design patterns are evolving and need input from a variety of perspectives. There is a growing trend towards decentralized computing systems in which distributed ledger technologies are a fundamental component. These systems are designed to be global computing systems; they will likely form the basis of new financial services and businesses including a distributed Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI). These new financial services and businesses could bring huge benefits to the global financial system. However financial regulators, central banks, the BIS and IMF, while recognizing the potential of DLT systems, have also been keenly aware of the challenges in the adoption, and designing for the consumer protections required to balance usability, safety while supporting innovation. While it is likely that many G20 countries will be leading the design and development of these new infrastructures, all countries should be considered and encouraged to participate in the planning.
