### Background
On June 8th and 9th 2019, Distributed Ledger Technology-related innovations have been referenced in the Communique at the G20 Finance and Central Bank Meeting in Fukuoka, Japan, referencing the report produced by [the Financial Stability Board (FSB).](https://fsb.org/about)

Section 13 "We welcome the FSB report on decentralized financial technologies, and the possible implications for financial stability, regulation and governance, and how regulators can enhance the dialogue with a wider group of stakeholders.”

[Blockchain Governance Initiative Network(BGIN - pronounced ‘BEGIN’)](https://bgin-global.org) ​was initiated on March 10, 2020 after several multi-stakeholder workshops including CoDeFi 2020, an associated workshop with Financial Cryptography 2020. This is a multi-stakeholder discussion network which aims at providing an open and neutral sphere for all stakeholders to deepen common understanding and to collaborate to address issues they face in order to attain sustainable development of the blockchain community.


### Workshop on Coordination of Decentralized Finance (CoDecFin)

This workshop is designed to identify and discuss technology and operation issues of permissionless blockchain and decentralized finance. As permissionless blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms evolve and mature, there is an urgent need for multi-stakeholders to engage in their planning, development, roll-out, and operation, in order for innovation of a wide variety of financial applications to proliferate and become mainstream. Thus far it has been mainly developer & startup communities which are driving these protocols, platforms, and applications for this new era of computing. New ​standards, governance mechanisms and design patterns​are evolving and need input from a variety of perspectives. There is a growing trend towards decentralized computing systems in which distributed ledger technologies are a fundamental component. These systems are designed to be global computing systems; they will likely form the basis of new financial services and businesses including a distributed Financial Market Infrastructure (dFMI). These new financial services and businesses could bring huge benefit to the global financial system, e.g. resiliency over

efficiency, and predictability over resiliency. However financial regulators, central banks, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), while recognizing the potential of DLT systems, have also been keenly aware of the challenges in the adoption, and designing for the consumer protections required to balance usability, safety while supporting innovation. While it is likely that many G20 countries will be leading the design and development of these new infrastructures, all cities and countries ​should be considered and encouraged to participate​in the planning.
Discussions of this workshop are expected to contribute to discussions of Blockchain Governance Initiative Network (BGIN), where common documents on blockchain technology and operations are created backed by all stakeholders. Hence, CoDecFin 2021 will be directly connected to the general meeting of BGIN. The second general meeting of BGIN (Block #2) will be held right after CoDecFin.

**Note: This workshop does not endorse any specific decentralized finance projects and products.**

## Basic Structure of the Workshop
This workshop is composed of three parts:
- Presentations of academic and practical results on blockchain technology and
operations
- Selected talks from ​all​a variety of stakeholders
- Discussions by multi-stakeholders on selected discussion topics.

## Call for papers
We call for papers on technology and operational issues related to decentralized finance and permissionless blockchain, and future directions to solve these issues with specifying background the author(s) have.
(i) regular papers (15 pages LNCS format excluding references and appendices), (ii) short papers (8 pages LNCS format in total),
Submission process is conducted by using EasyChair. We will open the submission site shortly.  

**This year, we encourage to submit a paper associated with the current discussion topic at BGIN.**
